Alternative Two Part Procedure

* Let each part run to completion.

Part One: 

ImageJ Results.csv file creation via two-part-macro.ijm 

1. Download ImageJ at https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html

2. Open ImageJ. In its menu atop your screen, select Plugins, select Macros, select Run.

3. In the first window that opens, first select your macro (two-part-macro.ijm) and click open.
In the second window that opens, select the folder which contains only the images you wish to analyze,
and click open.

4. Once the Results window opens, return to the ImageJ menu atop your screen and select File, select Save as, call the file Results.csv and place it in the same directory as your images.

5. Close the Results and ImageJ windows.

6. Open Results.csv file and inspect it. If the column headings do not match the data below them, adjust them accordingly. Delete the first column (numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.) in an editor such as Excel or Libreoffice, and save the file as "Results.csv"

Part Two:

1. Visit https://jcarabeonieva.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/

2. Decide whether to create image summary plots with doublets labeled and overlaid on the thresholded images.

3. Set a custom threshold value or leave as is (use the default distance 4).

4. Choose and upload the Results.csv file created in Part One.

5. Decide whether to provide keywords found in your image file names so that the website can organize your files into folders. 
Important notes on Step 5:
--------------------------
Examples of keywords:
nanos_exp_control_stage10_nurse, nanos_nonexp_control_stage10_nurse, nanos_exp_control_stage10_oocyte

Notice that these two keywords are separated from each other by the delimiter ", " (comma followed by a space).

(keyword1, keyword2)

Please use the delimiter shown above, otherwise your folders will not have the proper names and will not contain organized files.
